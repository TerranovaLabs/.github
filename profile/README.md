# TerranovaLabs

## 🚀 About Me

TerranovaLabs is a one-man software studio by Nathan Terranova, building production-grade tools at the intersection of architecture, automation, and software engineering.

Nathan began his career as an architect, earning his BArch in 2015 and achieving licensure in 2019. But a deep fascination with computational design tools like Grasshopper and Dynamo pulled him beyond scripting and into full-scale software development. By 2018, he had fully transitioned into C# and Python, evolving from Project Architect to Full-Stack Software Engineer.

Learning software engineering on the fly while working as an architect forced him to quickly grasp a broad array of concepts: UI/UX design, the .NET ecosystem, CI/CD, software architecture, user acceptance testing, and computational efficiency. Wearing many hats through this transition was difficult, but it forged the pragmatic, results-driven mindset that defines his work today. He focuses particularly on Revit API development, process automation, and building tools that genuinely empower others.

Nathan is passionate about eliminating inefficiency and helping people succeed through better technology. He's currently pursuing an online BS/MS in Computer Science to deepen his theoretical foundation alongside his professional practice. When he's not building, you'll find him exploring unique landscapes with his photographer wife Emily, enjoying electronic music and college football, or hanging out with his doggos.
